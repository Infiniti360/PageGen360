# Python Code Generation Fix

## Issue
The Python code generator was generating files as "undefined" for certain Python language variants.

## Root Cause
The `popup.js` file had a local implementation of the `generatePageObject` function that only handled basic `python` language, but was missing support for the more specific Python variants:
- `python-playwright`
- `python-webdriverio` 
- `cucumber-python`
- `behave-python`

When these specific Python variants were selected, the function didn't have a case for them, so it returned `undefined`.

## Solution
Updated the `popup.js` file to include proper support for all Python language variants:

### 1. Added Missing Language Cases
Added `else if` blocks for all missing Python variants:
- `python-playwright`
- `python-webdriverio`
- `cucumber-python`
- `behave-python`

### 2. Added Method Generation for Each Variant
Each Python variant now has proper method generation that handles:
- Input elements (text, checkbox, radio)
- Button elements
- Link elements
- Select dropdowns
- Image elements

### 3. Framework-Specific Implementations
- **python**: Uses Selenium WebDriver with `find_element()` and `send_keys()`
- **python-playwright**: Uses Playwright's `page.click()`, `page.fill()`, and `page.select_option()`
- **python-webdriverio**: Uses Selenium WebDriver (same as basic python)
- **cucumber-python**: Uses Selenium with Cucumber step definitions using `@when` decorators
- **behave-python**: Uses Selenium with Behave step definitions using `@when` decorators

### 4. Added Support for All Other Languages
Also added support for all other missing language variants to prevent similar issues:
- `webdriverio`
- `playwright`
- `puppeteer`
- `protractor`
- `nightwatch`
- `typescript-webdriverio`
- `typescript-playwright`
- `typescript-puppeteer`
- `typescript-protractor`
- `typescript-nightwatch`
- `cucumber-java`
- `cucumber-javascript`
- `specflow-csharp`
- `robot-framework`
- `gauge-java`
- `gauge-javascript`

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that verified all Python variants now generate proper content instead of "undefined".

## Result
All Python language variants now generate proper Python code files with the correct framework-specific syntax and structure.
